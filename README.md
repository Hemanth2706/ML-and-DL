This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model for Credit Card Fraud Detection in the banking domain. It involves a comprehensive workflow including data cleaning, preprocessing, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, and feature engineering. Various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost are applied, along with advanced deep learning techniques like RNN, LSTM, and GANs. The objective is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false negatives, enabling real-time fraud prevention and enhancing transaction security. Evaluation is based on metrics like AUC-ROC and Precision-Recall, with deliverables including a detailed report and a live Jupyter Notebook.
